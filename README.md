A project for a university about local sports clubs.

As a user, we can register an account. Then login to it. Login is authorized with JWT. We have the ability to add, delete, edit and delete sports clubs.

The backend of the project is written in C#, ASP.NET 7, while the Frontend is written in Vue, the connection to the database is done via migration.
